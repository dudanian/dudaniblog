I was originally planning to write this as a blog post, but it ended up being really long. Also, I wanted to try making one of those slick documentation sites I see with Rust resources so I decided to make it using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) instead. Overall, it was pretty painless! Aside from a small integration bug with Github pages.
